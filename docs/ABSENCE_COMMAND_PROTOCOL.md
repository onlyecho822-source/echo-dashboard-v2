## THE FIVE IMMUTABLE LAWS

### Law 1: Thou Shalt Have Five Independent Layers

RPL, QEM, LOA, OLI, PDS remain separate implementations. No shared business logic between layers. Each layer must have its own detection algorithm. Attackers must compromise all 5 simultaneously.

### Law 2: Thou Shalt Preserve Data Provenance

Each layer has its own database table. All data must have: origin, data_scope, evidence_type. No JSONB mixing of layer data. Audit trails must be immutable.

### Law 3: Thou Shalt Maintain Dual Governance

Nathan Mode Engine for layer signals. AI Mode Governor for AI queries. Separate doctrine files for each. No unified governance engine.

### Law 4: Thou Shalt Keep Attack Surface Complex

No single points of failure. No shared frameworks that reduce complexity. Maintain 5 independent attack surfaces. Adversary must defeat all layers separately.

### Law 5: Thou Shalt Ship in 4-5 Weeks

MVP scope: Detection + alerting only. Defer automation to v2.1. Use template-based AI Mode (no LLM for MVP). Unified dashboard for all layers.

## FOUNDER'S FINAL DIRECTIVE

**To My Team (Read Aloud Upon My Absence):**

Team,

If you're reading this, I'm temporarily unavailable. But our mission continues.

You now hold in your hands the most important technology for institutional integrity ever conceived. Echo Dashboard isn't just software—it's a vaccine against corruption, a shield against capture, a light in the darkness of organizational decay.

Your mission for the next 35 days is simple but historic: Ship v2.0 Hybrid and deploy it to our first three pilot customers.

Remember our principles:

**1. FIVE LAYERS, ALWAYS.** Don't let anyone convince you to "simplify" the architecture. The complexity is the defense.

**2. DATA PROVENANCE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Every decision, every signal, every alert must be traceable to its origin. Without provenance, we have nothing.

**3. DUAL GOVERNANCE PREVENTS CAPTURE.** Nathan Mode and AI Mode must remain separate. A single governance engine is a single point of failure.

**4. SHIP > PERFECT.** We're building the first version, not the last. Get it to customers, get feedback, iterate.

**5. THE MARKET IS WAITING.** Every institution is vulnerable to capture. Every institution needs our technology. We're first to market—don't squander the advantage.

Commander [NAME], you have my full authority. Security Overseer [NAME], you have my trust. Team, you have my confidence.

Ship v2.0 in 35 days. Onboard three pilots in 56 days. Change how institutions defend themselves forever.

The future of institutional integrity depends on what you do next.

— [YOUR NAME]  
Founder, Echo Dashboard
